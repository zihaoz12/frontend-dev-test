# front-end-dev-test

## Intro

Congratulations on making it to the testing phase of the hiring process! For this part of the hiring process, we would like to learn about your creativity, how well you code, and how well you follow instructions.

You will need to have knowledge of some key things before you start:
  - how to run a local server
  - how to connect your markup to your scripts and styles
  - front end web development

We have supplied an optional development server and some development dependencies for this project, but feel free to use the development framework of your choice (e.g. create-react-app, vue cli, etc). You are not required to use the codebase provided in this repository, but feel free to use it! If you choose to use this codebase, you can run the development server using the commands found below:

<pre>
  npm install
  npm start
</pre>

<em>NOTE: You will need node and npm on your machine if you choose to use the supplied server, also for hosting you will need to set it up yourself.</em>

  1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

    For this project, I only used HTML,CSS, and jQuery. And I have also used BootStrap for the Grid System and Carousel function.

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

    I had some hard time on making the web page become responsive. Because of the page layout and spacing will change on different screen. Each time I had created a new element, I would have to go back to make sure it would fit on different screen.It took me some time to fix these error spacings. 
    
  3. What you enjoyed the most and why

    Even though, trouble shooting and fixing bugs are painful in sometime. It feels great when I can figure out the solutions and I enjoyed to see the result that I want was perfectly showing on the screen.
